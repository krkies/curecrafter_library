The Carver Bridge to STEM Success Program was started at Simpson College in 2015 through NSF funding. The goal of the program is to prepare academically talented, Pell-eligible students in biology, environmental science, computer science, actuarial science, mathematics, and biochemistry/physics (BE-CAMP) to enter the growing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. An innovative hallmark of the program is the collaboration with industry mentors to provide research problems for students during their four years at Simpson. We will discuss how we established collaborations with local businesses and schools, how we coached the mentors to select research problems, and the status of the research problems after approximately 18 months of work between the students and mentors.
